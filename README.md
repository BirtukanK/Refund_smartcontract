# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
# Web3: Refund by location smart contract
The project is all about building an Ethereum based dApp that has both the smart contract tested and deployed in a testnet and a front end that will allow monitoring of the status.
